Keystone Platform
-----------------

Keystone Platform is a project you can just ignore. This is used for my bootstrapping of [keystonejs](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone) development. 

To create your own keystone project please refer to the [keystone documentation](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone#usage).

If you are pulling this code to verify a development issue with keystone, please remember to [npm link the keystone repro](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone#linking-keystone-for-development-and-testing).

-- That is all, nothing to see here... move along. :-)
